chrome-tab-gc
=============

**UPDATE** my addon was removed again by mozilla, because the documentation was to sparse.
Because I am lazy, I just uploaded the extension here instead:
https://github.com/Mic92/chrome-tab-gc/releases



A Garbage Collector extension for Chrome Tabs.

The idea behind the extension is that tabs that are not used are, well, useless.
Sometimes I find that I have tabs that I've opened a week ago and I have left open.
The visual clutter that comes with this is quite distractive.

The extension marks the time when the tab was active and closes the tab when it has been
inactive for specified time. Pinned tabs are not closed.

Following the great example set by this extension, firefox now also implemented a variant of it:

They just forgot implementing to actually close the tabs...
